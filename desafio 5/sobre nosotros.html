        <h2>Band's history</h2>
            <p>We are a British metalcore band from Sheffield, United Kingdom. We started in 2003. Our current discography is RCA Records worldwide and by Columbia Records for the United States exclusively. The musical style in our beginnings as well as that of our debut album "Count Your Blessings" was deathcore, but in the following albums we decided to adopt a more eclectic style of metalcore. However, our last album "That's The Spirit" marked a new twist in our musical style to produce a work not so aggressive and much more inclined towards alternative rock.</p>
        <br><h2>Beginnings</h2>
            <p>The idea of having a band began in 2002 with Oliver Sykes, Matt Nicholls and Lee Malia, sharing similar musical tastes. Before having the complete training, we played several songs that we did for fun. After inviting bassist Matt Kean, who was a member of other local bands, the formation ended up being Oliver Skyes as lead singer, drummer Matt Nicholls, guitarist Lee Malia and bassist Matt Kean. The name of the band comes from a phrase in the movie Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl: "Now bring me that horizon", an exception that was changed so as Bring Me The Horizon.</p>
            <p>In 2003 we recorded our first demo, "The Bedroom Sessions", with ages ranging from 13 to 17 years. The demo contained 5 songs, all of which were rewritten in later works of the band. After this EP the band signed with several record companies in different parts of the world. In the United Kingdom and Europe with Visible Noise and Earache Records, in Australia with Shock Records and in the United States and the rest of the world we signed with Epitaph Records.</p>
